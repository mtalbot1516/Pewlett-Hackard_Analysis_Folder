## Overview of Analysis
### The purpose of the analysis was to look into Pewlett Hackards employee files to plan for the large number of older employees who might be retiring somewhat soon, aka prepare for the "silver tsunami"

## Results
* When you sum all of the counts from the retiring titles table, you can see that over 90,000 employees at the company are of retiring age (born between 1952 and 1955) and still at the company!
* The most needed position to fill will be Senior Engineer, with 29,414 employees near retirment with this title. Note that Senior Staff is a close second with 28,254. See 'challenge/retiring_titles.csv' for more.
* The title with the least amount of projected turnover is Manager, with only 2 people within the retiring range
* When analyzing the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program, you can see that there are a little over 1900 employees in the given date range.

## Summary
### There are not nearly enough retirement ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation Pewlett Hackard. There are only 1940 employees in the date range. It might be beneficial to increase teh date range of employees available for the mentorship program
